This project is an interactive Luggage Carousel Simulation built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, designed to run in a web browser via Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension. It simulates an airport luggage carousel where colored rectangular luggage pieces spawn infinitely from the left side of a gray conveyor belt (1200x300 pixels) and move right at a constant speed. Users can click and drag luggage to a 3x3 storage grid (80x80 pixel cells) located above the belt, with the front row designated as a priority row outlined by a dashed boundary. The grid supports up to nine luggage pieces (one per cell). Clicking the "Unload" button removes one luggage piece at a time, following a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order, prioritizing items in the front row first, then regular rows. The unloading process is immediate per click, ensuring precise control. The project features a clean 2D interface with no external dependencies, providing a responsive and engaging user experience for managing luggage flow.
